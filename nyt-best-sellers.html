						<h2>Redesign of The New York Times Best Sellers list
						</h2>
							<h1 class="description">Wikipedia describes the Best Sellers list as, "widely considered the preeminent list of best-selling book in the United States." The list has expanded and contracted over its multi-decade history and is currently comprised of 31 individual lists organized by genre, format and subject matter. Each list is updated either weekly or monthly.</h1>

					<ul>
					<li>Partnered with the newsroom Best Sellers team to gain insights and identify our customers</li>

					<li>Analyzed our competitors, ideated on possible solutions and created research provocations to test those ideas</li>

					<li>Collaborated closely with research team to develop discussion guide, conduct research and interpret insights</li>
					
					<li>Iterated on the design based on research insights</li>
					
					<li>Discussed the designs with our engineering team and iterated based on technical limitations</li>

					<li>Partnered with our product manager to plan the scope of the project</li>

					<li>Paired with our engineers to polish the design in build, contributed CSS VQA code</li>

					<li>Usability tested the final design with the team</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3 class="kicker project">the challenge</h3>
					<p>To redesign the Best Seller list to improve the user experience and drive more traffic through referral links, in the process of migrating it to our new, responsive NYT5 platform.</p>	
					
						<h3 class="kicker project">initial research and identifying our customers</h3>
					<p>The product manager and I began our research by forming a partnership with the Best Sellers editorial team. We interviewed them to learn everything that they knew about the product, the business, customer types, customer behavior, limitations and opportunities.</p>	
					<p>From these early conversations we learned that the lists had two distinct customer types.</p>

					<p>Our primary customer is the reader who is looking for her next book. Our secondary customer type is the publisher who uses the lists to tracks the success of her titles.</p> 
					<p>We needed next to validate that these were the primary customer types, and to learn more about the behavior and needs of each customer type through additional research.</p>
					

					<h3 class="kicker project">prepping for additional customer research</h3>
					<p>At this point I did my own research into other book discovery tools and related products. I wanted to get a deeper sense for the product space. I used these tools to try to find a book for myself and made note of things that worked well and didn't, and considered how our own customers' needs might differ.</p> 
					<p>I put together a set of mocks that included a few keys features that seemed promising, but needed to be validated as such by our customers: navigation/filtering, book covers, Buy buttons next to every title, the vague concept of books that were Trending across lists, and a module for books that were New to the List.</p>
					<p>It's important to note that because the NYTimes is considered a neutral authority, commerce is very controversial. It is very important for the company to test things like Buy buttons to know if they fit well enough into the brand, or if we threaten to lose the respect or loyalty of our customers.</p>

					<h3 class="kicker project">customer research</h3>
					<p>I worked closely with our research team and product manager to create a research plan, survey and discussion guide to answer the questions outlined above. We posted the survey to the Books section of our website, collected a few hundred responses and recruited nine participants for in-house or video interviews.</p>

					<p>The interviews began with a discussion of our customers’ reading habits, and then we asked them to walk us through their use of the lists. In the second half of the interview we showed them the provocations that I’d designed to test their reactions to new features, and to provoke further discussion.</p>

					
					<h3 class="kicker project">customer research insights</h3>
					<ul>
					<li>The majority of our "look for my next book" customers visit only the landing page to scan the first few major lists for new titles. Because they used the lists primarily for discovery, they did not care so much about the details of a book's performance (weeks on the list, trending direction, sales ties, exact rank, and so on).</li>
					
							<li>Our publishers, on the other hand, wanted every bit of information that she could get. She frequently navigated to specific lists and printed out the pages so that she could share them with her team or with foreign publishing companies who might want to buy the rights to a specific title.</li>

					<li>Only one of nine testing participants knew that it was possible to purchase a book from the lists. It became clear that was because the Buy buttons were buried a few clicks deep in the lists, and colored a light grey so that they either did not stand out or looked inactive. </li>
					
					<li>"Looking for my next book" customers navigated to an online retailer in a separate tab to make a purchase, while the publisher was not looking to buy a book, she was looking to sell rights to her titles.
					</li>
					
					<li>Every participant identified the covers as a useful visual element for scanning and differentiating between what they'd seen before and what was new. But, as anticipated, the Buy buttons on every listing were controversial! All testing participants commented on these features, half thought they made the Times feel like a "store", which seemed off-brand, yet they still all unsolicitedly identified reasons why the Times would provide the opportunity to purchase, and said they wanted to support the Times to financially benefit from their purchase. 
					</li>
						<li>While participants expressed desire for the feature, “New to the list”, they were immediately put off by the word “Trending" - to them it felt too social media for the NYT. Once we got past the language, they did like the concept of getting a quick read on what was performing best across the top lists.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3 class="kicker project">debrief and planning</h3>
					<p>Since our goals were to improve the overall experience, and increase monetization, we decided to focus first on the "looking for my next book" customer type, while still supporting the needs of the publisher.
					
					<h3 class="kicker project">revised design proposal</h3>
					<p>I synthesized this feedback and I created a new set of designs that addressed our findings and goals.</p>
					
					<p>We could support both user types quite well with a tiered UI in which the landing page was geared towards a more visual browse and discover experience, and the individual list pages contained all additional information about the book, publisher and the book's performance. I proposed that the landing page preview the top 5 books from each list, with the lists ordered vertically by popularity. The top 5 lists accounted for a little over 85% of traffic, so I proposed that we only show the top 5 lists and make the rest easily accessible through navigation.</p>
					
					<p>I kept the Buy buttons on all listings, to familiarize our customers with the concept of purchasing through the list, and made these buttons NYT blue rather than grey to increase visibility.</p>
					<p>
					For navigation, I suggested that we use existing NYT filters to allow our customers to sort per list.

					<h3 class="kicker project">technical limitations and iteration</h3>
					<p>Initially I proposed that we use a pre-existing NYT5 filtering system to allow our customers to sort by list and date. As we began working on this solution, it became clear that this filtering system would not meet the needs of this project.</p> 
					<p>The filtering system did not update its URL per search, meaning a user could share only a link to the landing page, and that all existing URLs would need to redirect to this single landing page URL. A user could not navigate directly to an individual list, but would need to go to the landing page and filter each time.</p>
					<p>I worked through this design problem and proposed several fully responsive variations for expanding our NYT5 navigation to include dropdowns and a date range selector. Looking to the future, we build these into the platform in a way that could easily be reused for other products.
