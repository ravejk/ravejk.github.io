						<h2>Redesign of The New York Times Best Sellers list
						</h2>
							<h1 class="description">The NYTimes Best Sellers is the preeminent list of best-selling books in the United States. The list has expanded and contracted over its multi-decade history and is currently comprised of 31 individual lists organized by genre, format and subject matter. Each list is updated either weekly or monthly.</h1>

					<h3 class="kicker project">the challenge</h3>
					<p>To redesign the list, to improve user experience and to increase monetization by driving more traffic to referral links, under tight timeline and engineering constraints.</p>	
				
				
					<h3 class="kicker project">my role</h3>
					<ul>
					<li>Partnered with the newsroom Best Sellers team to gain insights and identify our customers</li>

					<li>Analyzed our competitors, ideated on possible solutions and created research provocations to test those ideas</li>

					<li>Collaborated closely with research team to develop discussion guide, conduct research and interpret insights</li>
					
					<li>Iterated on the design based on research insights</li>
					
					<li>Discussed the designs with our engineering team and iterated based on technical limitations</li>

					<li>Partnered with our product manager to plan the scope of the project</li>
					
					
					<li>Partnered with the branding design team to create placeholder book cover images and other graphic design collateral.</li>

					<li>Paired with our engineers to polish the design in build, contributed CSS VQA code</li>
						<li>Partnered with advertising and legal to iterate based on their needs.</li>

					<li>Usability tested the final design with the team</li>
					</ul>
					
					
						<h3 class="kicker project">initial research</h3>
					<p>The first step in this project was learning everything that the company knew about the lists. I worked closely with our product manager to develop a relationship with the Best Sellers editorial team to interview them for background and insights on the history of the product, brand associations, customer types, customer behavior, limitations and opportunities.</p>	
					<p>From these early conversations we learned that the lists had two distinct customer types.</p>
 <h3 class="kicker project">two customer types</h3>
					<p>From this initial research we learned that our primary customer is the reader who is looking for her next book.</p>
					<p>Our secondary customer type is the publisher who uses the lists to tracks the success of her titles.</p> 
					<p>We needed next to validate that these were the primary customer types, and to learn more about the behavior and needs of each customer through customer research.</p>
					

					<h3 class="kicker project">competitive analysis, ideation and provocations</h3>
					<p>At this point I had a sense for our customers and our business, and needed to learn more about the book discovery and book commerce space so I began researching competitors. I used each of these tools to try to find a book for myself and made note of things that worked well and didn't, and began thinking about how our own customers' needs might differ.</p> 
					<p>I put together some sketches for the product and discussed them with our team to figure out what we wanted to explore through additional research. We came up with a set of features to test and I turned those into mocks that we would test as provocations during customer research.</p>
					<p>The few keys features that we wanted to test were new navigation and filtering, book covers, Buy buttons next to every title, and modules for books that were either Trending across lists or New to the List.</p>
					<p>While none of these features seem particularly dicey, commerce and features that border on recommendations tend to generate controversy among our readers. So, it is very important for the company to test these concepts and how and if they fit into the brand.</p>

					<h3 class="kicker project">survey and customer research planning</h3>
					<p>Our product manager and I worked closely with our in-house research team to put together a survey, recruitment and in person testing plan.</p>
					<p>We created a survey that we posted on the Books and Best Sellers section fronts to collect customer insights from a larger number of readers (around 300). The survey helped us understand frequency and purpose of use, which validated that we did indeed have the two customer types outlined above.<p> 
						<p>Since our goals were to improve the overall experience, and to increase monetization, we decided to focus on our dominant, "looking for my next book" customer type, while still supporting the needs of our secondary customer, the publisher.</p>
						<p>From the group of survey participants we recruited 9 individuals for follow up conversations, 8 readers who were looking for their next book, and 1 publisher.</p>
					<p>We also developed a discussion guide to use during these sessions. The first half of the guide asked participants about their behaviors and needs, and asked them to walk through their use of the existing site. In the latter half, we showed them the provocations that I'd created, to learn more.</p>
					<p>During testing sessions, our team was able to watch the interviews via a video feed to a second room. Our PM and I made sure that our newsroom team as well as our developers were present so that we were all sharing in learnings, and able to discuss insights and implications together. After the day of testing was complete, I facilitated a discussion around insights and takeaways, open questions and concerns, known and possible technical limitations, and early ideas around what the first version of the product should include. I took notes and shared these out with the group.

					<h3 class="kicker project">customer research insights</h3>
					<ul>
					<li>The majority of our "look for my next book" customers visits only the landing page to scan the first few major lists for new titles. Because they used the lists primarily for discovery, they did not care so much about the details of a book's performance (weeks on the list, trending trajectory, sales ties, historical lists and so on).</li>
					
							<li>Our publishers, on the other hand, wanted every bit of information that she could get. Publishers frequently navigated to specific lists, and regularly referenced older lists, and then printed out the pages so that she could share them with their team or with foreign publishing companies who were interesting in buy the rights to a specific title.</li>

					<li>Only one of nine testing participants knew that it was possible to purchase a book from the lists. It became clear that was because the Buy buttons were buried a few clicks deep in the lists, and were a light grey so that they either did not stand out or appeared inactive. </li>
					
					<li>To make a purchase, "looking for my next book" customers navigated to an online retailer in a separate tab. The publisher was not interesting in purchasing any books. Instead, she was looking to sell rights to her titles.
					</li>
					
					<li>Every participant identified the covers as a useful visual element for scanning and differentiating between what they'd seen before and what was new. But, as anticipated, the Buy buttons on every listing were controversial! Half of the participants thought that the covers and Buy buttons made the lists feel like a "store", which felt wrong for the Times as a neutral authority. But, despite this criticism, all proponents of the store feel also unsolicitedly identified reasons why the Times would provide the opportunity to purchase, and said they wanted to support the Times to financially benefit from their purchase.  
					</li>
						<li>While participants expressed desire for the feature, “New to the list”, they were immediately put off by the word “Trending". "Trending felt like a cool social media term, which was off brand for the NYTimes. Once we got past the language, they did like the concept of getting a quick read on what was performing best across the top lists.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3 class="kicker project">revising the design</h3>
					<p>Using testing insights and debrief notes, I iterated on the mocks.</p>
					
					<p>We could support both user types quite well with a tiered UI in which the landing page was geared towards a more visual browse and discover experience, and the individual list pages contained all additional information about the book, publisher and the book's performance. I suggested that the landing page contain the top 5 books from each list, ordered by popularity. The customer would see the most popular lists and titles on page load, and could scroll to load additional lists. This would allow her to discover new lists without needing to click through to another page.</p>
					
					<p>I kept the Buy buttons on all listings, to familiarize our customers with the concept of purchasing through the list, and made these buttons NYT blue rather than grey to increase visibility.</p>
					<p>
					For navigation, I suggested that we use existing NYT filters to allow our customers to sort per list.
					</p>
					<p>
					I suggested also that we have a New to the List module at the top of the page.	
					</p>

					<h3 class="kicker project">technical limitations and iteration</h3>
					<p>Once product and design had defined what we'd like to achieve in the product,</p>
					<p>In the initial design I suggested that we use a pre-existing NYT5 filtering system to allow our customers to sort by list and date. As we began working on this solution, it became clear that this filtering system would not meet the needs of this project.</p> 
					<p>The filtering system did not update its URL per search which meant that a user could share only a link to the landing page, and that all existing URLs would redirect to the landing page URL. There would be no possibility of promoting or navigating directly to an individual list. The only way to see an individual list would be to filter from the landing page. This was a really limited and unsatisfying user experience.</p>
					<p>After surveying our options and talking more with our developers, I determined that the best path forward would be to evolve a different but equally limited pre-existing navigation to include a date selector, to accommodate a larger quantity of list items via dropdowns, and to be fully responsive.
						</p>
					<p>Another technical limitation was that our developers didn't have sufficient time to build an endless scroll feature into the landing page. They presented us with two options: we either display all covers on page load, or pare down the number of lists. Loading all images would significantly impact landing page performance and, furthermore, many of these covers would never be seen, so it didn't make sense to load all lists. To determine what the cut off point should be, our product manager and I looked at traffic data to lists and found that the top 5 lists accounted for a little over 85% of traffic. This insight made our decision super easy. We proposed that the landing page show the top 5 lists and make the rest easily accessible through navigation.</p>
						<p>Given resourcing and technical constraints, and a bit of pushback from users during testing, our product manager ultimately decided to punt on the New to the List and Trending modules for V1, and to consider them for a future iteration of the product.
