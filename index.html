						<div class="col">
							<p>I spent 2017 with VICE, leading research and design of a new international CMS. I also led research around the next generation of our mobile apps.</p>
							<h2>CMS</h2>
							<p>Prior to 2016, VICE existed as many websites throughout the world, independently maintained. This made it difficult and expensive to share content across verticals and locations. In 2016 they created a single master website and a new CMS to manage them. The new CMS was working, but there was a lot of opportunity for improvement.</p>
							<p>When I joined in 2017, I noticed that much of our CMS roadmap was in reaction to editorial requests and that our tech team lacked an understanding of the editorial process that we were designing to support, so I led a research project to understand and document our editorial workflows.</p>

							<img style="width: 100%;" src="images/VICE_Research_2-cropped.png">
							<p>By understanding our users and their current behavior and needs, we were able to identify touchpoints for the CMS, prioritize work and determine what not to build. This research also helped us collect previously unarticulated needs and editorial best practices.</p>
							<p>I presented this work back to our team through a lunch and learn, and applied our insights by making design revisions to the CMS.</p>

							<h2>Mobile Research</h2>
							<p>Our mobile team had lots of ideas about how to improve our existing suite of apps, but little insight into user behavior and needs. I led a research project to help us understand our users, to gauge their reaction to the concepts that we were exploring, and to inform our product roadmap.</p>
							<p>For this project I created an ad that directed our mobile app users to a Typeform survey.</p>
							<span class="photo-caption">The ad we ran on Instagram and Facebook to drive users to our survey.</span>

							<img style="width: 100%;" src="images/VICE-Research-facebook-ad.png">
							<p>With the survey results I was able to identify users who were within our target market, and contact them for hour long remote or in person interviews.</p>
							<span class="photo-caption">Our survey response data, color coded by different user types within our target market.</span>

							<p>In these interviews I focused on understanding our users's existing behavior and needs through open ended questions, problem hypotheses and design provocations.</p>
							<span class="photo-caption">A remote user interview with one our loyal app users.</span>
							<img style="width: 100%;" src="images/vice-mobile-nda.png">
							<p> I transcribed these conversations, distilled patterns and notable insights and shared this summary back to our mobile team, along with some actioable suggestions. Together we discussed implications and the team made revisions to their product roadmap.</p>

							<p>ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, came to Neo (a consulting studio I worked for) with the primary objective of more deeply engaging community newcomers.</p>
							<p>In collaboration with ICANN leadership, we kicked off the project with business and user need assumptions.</p>
							<p>We launched ICANN Labs, a space for exploring solutions to various conversion, learning, discovery and communication bottlenecks. We did customer development and usability testing with new and established members of the community to iterate and revise our projects.</p>
							<p>Over the course of ten months we built the new <a href="https://new.icann.org/" target="_blank">ICANN.org</a> and continue to iterate on the site.</p>
							<p>I was responsible for customer development research planning and facilitation and leading interaction design. I interfaced with the client on policy and public comment features and also contibuted to the styleguide as well as product, content writing and front-end development.<p>

							<p>In a single classroom, some students are performing below level, some at level and some below. How do you teach a single lesson to such a wide range of levels? Studies show that skill-based differentiated instruction is incredibly effective, though it can be daunting for teachers.</p>
							<p>I designed and conducted user interviews with our K-2 teachers to understand the complexities of differentiated instruction, existing behaviors and solutions, unarticulated needs and opportunties. I prototyped potential design solutions using inVision, validated the concepts with our teachers and then iterated on them until we had a valuable core offering.</p>
