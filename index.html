							<h1>VICE Media</h1>
							<p class="sans small-sans">Research Lead | Strategy | UX/UI Design | Prototyping</p>
							<p>VICE is an international media company known for its limited bias, alternative reporting. I joined the team to help establish a user research practice by leading research and design on a new international CMS. I also led research around the next generation of mobile apps.</p>
						<div class="col">

							</div>
							<h2>CMS</h2>
							<p>Prior to 2016, VICE existed as countless independent websites throughout the world. This disjointed system made it difficult and expensive to share content across verticals and locations. In 2016 they created a single master website and a new Content Management System to maintain it. The new CMS was working, but there was a lot of opportunity for improvement.</p>
							<p class="bottom-space">When I joined in 2017, I noticed that much of our CMS roadmap was planned in reaction to editorial requests, and that our design work was based on narrow anecdotes and intuition rather than insights. We needed a holistic understanding of the editorial process to get out ahead of our editorial staff, to determine which problems would best be solved with technology, and how, so I led a research project to do just this.</p>
							<p>I set up user interviews with editors in chief across our verticals and asked them to walk me through their editorial process, from end to end. I observed existing tools, opportunities for improvement, patterns and best practices, and when and how the CMS was used.</p>
							<div class="photo">
								<img class="img-70" src="images/VICE_Research_2-cropped.png">
								<p class="photo-caption">Conducting an in person user interview with one of our staff.</p>
							</div>
							<p>I extended the research to include various other editorial roles, summarized and diagrammed this processes to our Tech team and presented these insights to the team through a lunch and learn, and applied our insights by making design revisions to the CMS.</p>

							</div>
							<p>This research and the resulting design changes were so effective that I conducted similar research around our video workflows as well as our translation and international distribution processes. In addition to video folks and internationals, I conducted interviews with our legal rights and clearances team, translators and other relevant stakeholders.</p> 
							<p>Through this work we made huge strides in automating tedious work and otherwise increasing speed and ease of use.</p>

							<h2>Mobile Research</h2>
							<p>Our mobile team had lots of ideas about how to improve our existing suite of apps, but little insight into user behavior and needs. I led a research project to help us understand our users, to gauge their reaction to the concepts that we were exploring, and to inform our product roadmap.</p>
							<p>For this project I created a simple ad to direct our mobile app users to a Typeform survey so that we could identify participants for hour long user interviews.</p>

							<p>I designed and conducted user interviews with our K-2 teachers to understand the complexities of differentiated instruction, existing behaviors and solutions, unarticulated needs and opportunties. I prototyped potential design solutions using inVision, validated the concepts with our teachers and then iterated on them until we had a valuable core offering.</p>
