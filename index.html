							<h1>VICE Media</h1>
							<p class="sans small-sans">Research Lead | Strategy | UX/UI Design | Prototyping</p>
							<p>VICE is an international media company known for its limited bias, alternative reporting. I joined the team to help establish a user research practice by leading research and design on a new international CMS. I also led research around the next generation of mobile apps.</p>

							</div>
							<h2>CMS</h2>
							<p>Prior to 2016, VICE existed as countless independent websites throughout the world. This disjointed system made it difficult and expensive to share content across verticals and locations. In 2016 they created a single master website and a new Content Management System to maintain it. The new CMS was working, but there was a lot of opportunity for improvement.</p>
							<p class="bottom-space">When I joined in 2017, I noticed that much of our CMS roadmap was planned in reaction to editorial requests, and that our design work was based on narrow anecdotes and intuition rather than insights. We needed a holistic understanding of the editorial process to get out ahead of our editorial staff, to determine which problems would best be solved with technology, and how, so I led a research project to do just this.</p>
							<p>I set up user interviews with editors in chief across our verticals and asked them to walk me through their editorial process, from end to end. I observed existing tools, opportunities for improvement, patterns and best practices, and when and how the CMS was used.</p>
							<div class="photo">

								<p class="photo-caption">Conducting an in person user interview with one of our staff.</p>
							</div>
							<p>I extended the research to include various other editorial roles, summarized and diagrammed this processes to our Tech team and presented these insights to the team through a lunch and learn, and applied our insights by making design revisions to the CMS.</p>

							<p>This research and the resulting design changes were so effective that I conducted similar research around our video workflows as well as our translation and international distribution processes. In addition to video folks and internationals, I conducted interviews with our legal rights and clearances team, translators and other relevant stakeholders.</p> 
							<p>Through this work we made huge strides in automating tedious work and otherwise increasing speed and ease of use.</p>

							<h2>Mobile Research</h2>
							<p>Our mobile team had lots of ideas about how to improve our existing suite of apps, but little insight into user behavior and needs. I led a research project to help us understand our users, to gauge their reaction to the concepts that we were exploring, and to inform our product roadmap.</p>
							<p>For this project I created a simple ad to direct our mobile app users to a Typeform survey so that we could identify participants for hour long user interviews.</p>

							<p>During my two years at the Times I collaborated closely with editorial to research, design and launch a Publisher's Award winning analytics tool for the newsroom, worked on several new product discovery research projects, redesigned the Best Sellers list, and contributed to the evolution of a new responsive platform.</p>

							</div>
							<p>Stela is an award winning internal analytics tool that aggregates reader behavior data. I collaborated with a product manager and a research facilitator to validate and collaboratively design the tool with our newsroom staff. Stela was originally built to get the newsroom to care about data, but has been adopted by all departments.

							<h2>Best Sellers Redesign</h2>

							</div>
							
							<p>The Best Sellers list is a very famous list of book sales that many people to choose their next read. Our design and tech team had some ideas about what we thought might improve the experience, but our newsroom staff was nervous about change. We invited them to be a part the process, from discovery research with loyal readers, through to launch, so that we that they'd have visibility and input on the work.</p>
							<div class="photo">
								<img class="img-100" src="images/BS-Old.png">
								<p class="photo-caption">This is how the Best Sellers list looked before we redesigned it. It had not been touched in years.</p>
							</div>
							<p>To kick off this project, the product manager and I first conducted stakeholder interviews with our newsroom team to get some product background and to collect any existing knowledge of our readers. We used this information, along with Google Analytics, to generate an interception survey to recruit loyal readers for in depth user interviews.</p>
							<p>In the interviews, we asked readers to walk us through how they use the list today, and then gauged their reaction to potential new features. After the interiews, I led a debrief session with all stakeholders in which we shared out themes and surprising insights. This led into a discussion of some of our biggest hopes, fears and opportunties, and put everyone on the same page about who we were designing for a what they needed.</p>

							<p>We launched ICANN Labs, a space for exploring solutions to various conversion, learning, discovery and communication bottlenecks. We did customer development and usability testing with new and established members of the community to iterate and revise our projects.</p>
