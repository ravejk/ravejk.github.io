					<h2>Raven is a freelance UX Strategist and Product Designer living in Brooklyn.</h2>
					<h3>She has over 5 years of experience translating business and user needs into effective products through Research, UX Strategy and Design. Her process focuses on questioning assumptions, validating concepts early and often, and iterating to an effective product. </h3>
						<h3>She began freelancing in December of 2016, after 2 years at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>. Among her work at The Times, she led the design of a Publisher's Award winning proprietary analytics tool called <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/07/the-new-york-times-is-trying-to-narrow-the-distance-between-reporters-and-analytics-data/" target="_blank">Stela</a>, the design of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/still-processing?_r=0" blank="_blank">NYT Podcasts</a>, and the redesign of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/?_r=0" target="_blank">Best Sellers list</a>. She helped evolve the Times' first responsive framework, which powers section fronts like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/section/t-magazine" target="_blank">T Magazine</a>, and has done discovery and customer development research and provocations for new product explorations including the recently launched <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/watching" target="_blank">NYT Watching</a>.
						</h3>
						<h3>Prior to The Times she spent a year and a half refining her product design process at <a href="http://neo.com/" target="_blank">Neo</a>, a Lean UX consultancy led by the guys who literally wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lean-UX-Applying-Principles-Experience/dp/1449311652" target="_blank">the book</a>. Her projects included defining the <a href="http://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker" target="_blank">Singaporean Government's online work permit</a> process, <a href="https://www.icann.org/" target="_blank">ICANN.org</a> with a focus on policy process and tools, shipping and mailing flows for <a href="https://www.canadapost.ca/cpotools/apps/track/personal/findByTrackNumber?execution=e2s1" target="_blank">Pitney Bowes' Canadian mailing offerings</a>, Amplify's K-2 lesson planning tools, and helping to define <a href="https://www.taprootplus.org/consultants?utm_source=taprootfoundation&utm_campaign=tf_organic&utm_medium=web&utm_content=do_page_button" target="_blank">Taprootplus.org</a>.</h3>
						<h3>She also worked with Priceline for several months to redefine the My Trips user account experience, and launched a side project called <a href="http://www.oldsf.org/" target="_blank">OldSF.org</a> which maps the San Francisco Public Library's digital photo collections.</h3>
						<h3>Her teaching experience includes instructing <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/raven-keller/1867" target="_blank">User Experience Design at General Assembly</a> and <a href="https://www.cooper.com/training" target="_blank">Ideation and Interation Design workshops with Cooper</a>. She wrote curriculum for <a href="http://trydesignlab.com/courses/" target="_blank">DesignLab's activity-based UX course</a>, and mentors DesignLab students for both this course and another on UX Strategy and Research.</h3>
