							<p>ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, came to Neo (a consulting studio I worked for) with the primary objective of more deeply engaging community newcomers.</p>
							<p>In collaboration with ICANN leadership, we kicked off the project with business and user need assumptions.</p>
							<p>We launched ICANN Labs, a space for exploring solutions to various conversion, learning, discovery and communication bottlenecks. We did customer development and usability testing with new and established members of the community to iterate and revise our projects.</p>
							<p>Over the course of ten months we built the new <a href="https://new.icann.org/" target="_blank">ICANN.org</a> and continue to iterate on the site.</p>
							<p>I was responsible for customer development research planning and facilitation and leading interaction design. I interfaced with the client on policy and public comment features and also contibuted to the styleguide as well as product, content writing and front-end development.</p>

							<p>Each year thousands of individuals move to Singapore for work. The government's application and renewal process was so poorly designed that a professional middleman emerged to interface between employers, employees and the goverment.</p>
							<p>I spent five weeks in Singapore working with their work pass staff as well as designers and developers from IDEO and Thoughtworks. We took two year's worth of research and designed a prototype that we validated and iterated on with staff and target market customers.</p>

							<p>In a single classroom, some students are performing below level, some at level and some below. How do you teach a single lesson to such a wide range of levels? Studies show that skill-based differentiated instruction is incredibly effective, though it can be daunting for teachers.</p>
							<p>I designed and conducted customer development research with our target market K-2 teachers to understand the complexities of differentiated instruction as well as existing solutions, hacks and emergent behaviour that could inform solution design. I put together clickable medium-fidelity mocks and iterated based on teacher feedback.</p>

							<p>For the first 15 years of its life, Taproot awarded a few non-profits a year with $75k grants and a team of highly skilled pro bono professionals who helped them with things like marketing, findraising, and website redesign. The brand was so strong that they had thousands of pro bono consultants lined up to be matched on a project. In their 16th year they decided to expand their offerings to match these queued consultants with non-profits who did receive a grants.</p>
							<p>I co-facilitated the client kickoff workshop, designed and facilitated customer development research throughout the project, proposed the marketplace strategy and sketched out some of the main components of the initial user interface.</p>
