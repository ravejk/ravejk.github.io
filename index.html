					<h2>Raven is a freelance UX Strategist living in Brooklyn.</h2>
					<h3>She has 5 years of experience gathering insights around complex problems, and translating them into simple, effective solutions.</h3>
						<h3>She began freelancing in December of 2016, after 2 years at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>. Among her work there, she led design and co-led research for Publisher's Award winning proprietary analytics tool, <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/07/the-new-york-times-is-trying-to-narrow-the-distance-between-reporters-and-analytics-data/" target="_blank">Stela</a>, and for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/?_r=0" target="_blank">Best Sellers list</a> redesign. She worked with editors to evolve the Times' first responsive, structured data framework, which powers section fronts like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/section/t-magazine" target="_blank">T Magazine</a>, and has contributed to the research and exploration of new products, including the recently launched <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/watching" target="_blank">NYT Watching</a>.
						</h3>
						<h3>Prior to The Times she spent a year and a half doing research, design and lean validation at <a href="http://neo.com/" target="_blank">Neo</a>, a consultancy led by the authors of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lean-UX-Applying-Principles-Experience/dp/1449311652" target="_blank">O'Reilly Lean UX</a>. Her projects there included research and prototyping for the admin side of the <a href="http://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker" target="_blank">Singaporean Government's online work permit process</a>, policy process and tools for <a href="https://www.icann.org/" target="_blank">ICANN.org</a>, shipping and mailing flows for <a href="https://www.canadapost.ca/cpotools/apps/track/personal/findByTrackNumber?execution=e2s1" target="_blank">Pitney Bowes' Canadian mailing offerings</a>, Amplify's lesson planning tools for K-2 teachers, and UX for <a href="https://www.taprootplus.org/consultants?utm_source=taprootfoundation&utm_campaign=tf_organic&utm_medium=web&utm_content=do_page_button" target="_blank">Taprootplus.org</a>.</h3>
						<h3>She also worked with Priceline for several months to redefine their post-purchase user account experience (My Trips), and launched a side project called <a href="http://www.oldsf.org/" target="_blank">OldSF.org</a> which makes for easy exploration of the San Francisco Public Library's digital photo collection.</h3>
						<h3>Her teaching experience includes instructing <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/raven-keller/1867" target="_blank">User Experience Design at General Assembly</a> and <a href="https://www.cooper.com/training" target="_blank">Ideation and Interation Design workshops with Cooper</a>.
