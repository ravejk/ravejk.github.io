							</div>
							<h3>The Project</h3>
							<p>When a customer signs up for internet with Cox, they have two options for setting up their new service: they can schedule a technician visit, or they can do it themselves with the use of a Cox self-install kit.</p> 
							<p>Cox hired us to help them assess the current self-install customer journey, and to identify near term and further afield opportunities to improve the experience.</p>
							<h3>Primary Research Questions</h3>
							<p>We wanted to understand the current state of all phases of the self-install process, and our customer's perceptions, preferences, behavior and needs throughout that process. We wanted to observe the process to identify usability errors, and to observe customer's initial reaction to some of the product team's hypotheses by testing an early prototype of a future version of the kit. We also wanted to understand how we could improve the product in the short term, and in the future.</p>
							<h3>Research Approach</h3>
							<p><p>We wanted to observe first time Cox self-install customers throughout the entire self-install process, from initial sales call through to activating their new internet at home, and we wanted to observe folks with a diverse in their technical savviness, age, gender, and mobility. This recruit would need to be intercepted at the point of sales or kit pickup, which was going to be a timeconsuming process.</p>
							<p>We decided to focus two days on retail incerceptions, with the expection of 6-10 participants, and to do a larger number of mock interviews with existing Cox internet customers who had received a technician install. This way, they would be doing a self-install for the first time, could still tell us about their experience learning about and purchasing their internet plan, and provide us with insight into why they'd chosen the technician install over the self-install and how the two compared.</p></p>
							<h4>In home observation, contextual inquiry, usability testing</h4>
							<p>We conducted 32 interviews in home with existing Cox customers who had not previously done a self-install. We recruited for a diversity in technical savviness, age, gender, and mobility, to observe the range that's reflective of Cox's existing customer base.</p><p>We started with background questions to understand their experience learning about and purchasing home internet, and then observed them mock install their internet using the kit.</p>
							<h4>Prototype testing</h4>
							<p>After observing participants install their internet, we showed them an early prototype of a future version of the kit to get their initial reaction, and to facilitate conversation around the design of the kit materials themselves.</p>
							<h4>Quantitative Scoring</h4>
							<p>We used quantitative scoring throughout these interviews. At key moments throughout the self-install observation, we asked participants to rate their level of satisfaction on a Likert scale. This allowed us to quantify their joy and frustration, and to chart the ups and downs that they experienced throughout the process.</p>
							<p>Each session included a moderator and a notetaker. The notetaker was trained to note each time the participant made an error, and to numberically record the severity of each error of a 5 point scale. A 1 point error was a mistake that was easily recovered from, and a 5 point error was a total fail that could not be recovered from except through a technician's visit.</p>
							<h4>Retail observation and Interception</h4>
							<p>After our mock installs, we understood the install process quite well and had already identified some major patterns and themes, but we still wanted to observe the entire experience live with true first time Cox internet self-install customers to observe elements of the experience that
							<p>We spent two days on the floor in two different retail stores to observe sales and pickup firsthand, and to approach customers and invite them to participate in research. We successfully observed 6 complete self-installs this way and acquired an incredibly rich set of additional insights.</p>
							<h4>Sales and Support Call listening</h4>
							<p>At this point we had little data on the customer experience of the sales process and support calls, so we coordinted with Cox to listen in on a larger number of calls.</p>
							<h4>Results</h4>
							<p>As part of the distillation and reporting process, we developed user types to help Cox understand which customer types are within their target market for self-install. I also collaborated with our design team on a map of the existing customer journeys.</p>
							<p>We reported our findings to Cox and, through a multi-day workshop, generated and ranked potential solutions and ideal journey.</p>
							<h3>My Role</h3>
							<p>I led a research team of four, co-led our client relationship and contributed to product strategy. I worked in collaboration with project manager, a product designer, an industrial designer, and a strategist.</p>
