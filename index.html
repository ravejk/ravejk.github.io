						<p class="sans small-sans">Research Lead | Strategy | UX/UI Design | Prototyping</p>
						<div class="col">
							<p>I spent 2017 with VICE, leading research and design of a new international CMS. I also led research around the next generation of our mobile apps.</p>
							<h2>CMS</h2>
							<p>Prior to 2016, VICE existed as many websites throughout the world, independently maintained. This made it difficult and expensive to share content across verticals and locations. In 2016 they created a single master website and a new CMS to manage them. The new CMS was working, but there was a lot of opportunity for improvement.</p>
							<p>When I joined in 2017, I noticed that much of our CMS roadmap was in reaction to editorial requests and that our tech team lacked an understanding of the editorial process that we were designing to support, so I led a research project to understand our editorial workflows.</p>
							<p>Through this work we were able to identify touchpoints for the CMS, prioritize work and determine what not to build. We also collected previously unarticulated needs and editorial best practices.</p>
							<p>I presented this work back to our team through a lunch and learn, and applied our insights by improving existing features and designing new ones.</p>
							<img  src="images/.png" class="no-border">
							<p>This work was so successful that I went on to do the same for our video workflows, for our process of translating and distributing content internationally.</p>
							<img  src="images/.png" class="no-border">
							<h2>Mobile</h2>
							<p>Our mobile team had lots of ideas about how to improve our existing suite of apps, but little insight into user behavior and needs. I led a research project to help us understand our users, to gauge their reaction to the concepts that we were exploring, and to inform our product roadmap.</p>
							<p>For this project I created an ad that sent our mobile app user to a Typeform survey to help us identify target market participants for user interviews. I contacted loyal app users and scheduled hour long remote and in person interviews to understand their existing behavior and to gauge their reaction to our product hypotheses through problem statements and design provocations. I then distilled these insights and shared them back to our mobile team, who significantly revised their product roadmap. I also shared an annotated version of insights to our broader tech team.</p>

							<p>ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, came to Neo (a consulting studio I worked for) with the primary objective of more deeply engaging community newcomers.</p>
							<p>In collaboration with ICANN leadership, we kicked off the project with business and user need assumptions.</p>
							<p>We launched ICANN Labs, a space for exploring solutions to various conversion, learning, discovery and communication bottlenecks. We did customer development and usability testing with new and established members of the community to iterate and revise our projects.</p>
							<p>Over the course of ten months we built the new <a href="https://new.icann.org/" target="_blank">ICANN.org</a> and continue to iterate on the site.</p>
							<p>I was responsible for customer development research planning and facilitation and leading interaction design. I interfaced with the client on policy and public comment features and also contibuted to the styleguide as well as product, content writing and front-end development.</p>

							<p>In a single classroom, some students are performing below level, some at level and some below. How do you teach a single lesson to such a wide range of levels? Studies show that skill-based differentiated instruction is incredibly effective, though it can be daunting for teachers.</p>
							<p>I designed and conducted user interviews with our K-2 teachers to understand the complexities of differentiated instruction, existing behaviors and solutions, unarticulated needs and opportunties. I prototyped potential design solutions using inVision, validated the concepts with our teachers and then iterated on them until we had a valuable core offering.</p>

						<h2>Designing for the physical world</h2>
						<div class="col">
							<p>In high school I started my first business, a women's clothing company using vintage and recycled materials.</p> 
							<p>I designed and sewed the clothes myself - first in my bedroom and later in my college dormroom. I learned pattern design by taking apart my favorite garments to see how they were constructed.</p><p>In 2013 I decided to do the same with shoes. I deconstructed a few favorite pairs of vintage sandals that I'd picked up at a flea market in Paris.</p>
							<p> From the unstitched pieces I developed patterns and then made some paper prototypes. I modified those to get the right fit before cutting the pieces out of leather.</p><p> My next step is to find a well-ventilated workshop for assembly!</p>
